# simple-form-react-node

This is a simple app which allows you to creat the user and then creat the event which will be associated with just added user.

## Installation

The app is using a mongodb container so to make it works you need to install a docker on your computer.

After getting the docker on your computer you can enter to the main dir which contains ./node & ./React. There you have to run the `docker-compose up`. The installation process can take a moment

After that you can go to your browser and check the `http://localhost:3000/`, where you should find that the app is running.
